# crossword-to-scribe

Takes a NYT Crossword and sends it straight to your Kindle for your e-ink solving pleasure! Tried to make this as simple as possible so that even the layperson with technology can get to solving.

Starting as a basic, thrown together project for my wife, I wanted to make this available to the world for others to partake in. The NYTGames app is great, but there's nothing quite like writing the crosswords out on "paper".

## Requirements

Any technical requirements listed below will be walked through in the [tutorial video](#tutorial-video) *and* the [step-by-step instructions](#step-by-step-instructions) below.

- A tiny bit of patience
